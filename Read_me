WARNING: The code has not finished yet. We're at the fifth step at the moment. - 20/10/2020

Step 1: Draw a sketch using sketch_input_interface.py
That will save the sketch in ndjson format to the ndjson_files directory.

Step 2: (Optional) If you want to see the simplified version of the sketch in the png format run to_png.py
That will save the sketch in the png_sketches directory as a png image.

Step 3: To give the sketch as the input to the model, we need to convert it to an npz file. Run to_npz
Your input will be saved in npz_files directory. (util_npz is a file required for this one)

Step 4: Give your npz file to the model and extract the embedding.npz file.
--> You can use these as input both for Sketch_RNN and Sketch-transformer models. 

Step 5: Give embeddings to the euclidian.py to extract distance knowledge as a dictionary.

Step 6: visualize_latent_space will visualize the selected cases.


--------------------------------

qd_data_ndjson_by_irem can be used to create random simplified qd ndjson files for sub-sampling.
tSNE is not written by us. We're trying to make it work for visualization purposes.
npz_to_text.py serves as an input file creator for tSNE at the moment.

npz_to_png will be the shortcut visualization of npz_format images.
