Step 1: Draw a sketch using sketch_input_interface.py
That will save the sketch in ndjson format to the ndjson_files directory.

Step 2: (Optional) If you want to see the simplified version of the sketch in the png format run to_png.py
That will save the sketch in the png_sketches directory as a png image.

Step 3: To give the sketch as the input to the model, we need to convert it to an npz file. Run to_npz
Your input will be saved in npz_files directory.

Step 4: Give your npz file to the model and extract the embedding.npz file.

Step 5: Give embeddings to the euclidian.py to extract distance knowledge

Step 6: visualize_latent_space will visualize the selected cases.
